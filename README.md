## 👩‍💻 My Contribution

I worked on:
- Designing and building the full **UI screens**
- Creating all custom illustrations and the app icon manually
- Connecting navigation between the timer, star jar, and success screens
- Ensuring the design stays consistent, engaging, and calming
- Designed using **CBL methodology** learned at the **Apple Developer Academy**
